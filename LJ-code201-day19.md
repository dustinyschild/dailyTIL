<h1>Code 201, Day 19</h1>

<p>
  Today was our last day to add pieces to our project, I am excited and nervous
  for Code 201 to be over, I am looking forward to going back and being able
  to implement some of the work habits I've learned on the other projects.
  It's been a long, difficult week and I am ready to present. I am looking
  forward to being able to test my presentation skills and my ability to
  facilitate our presentation.
