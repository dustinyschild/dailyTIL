<h1>Code 201, Day 10</h1>

<p>
  Today we covered quite a few topics and the day seemed to just fly by. We started the day doing some code review, which today we went over Benjamin's project. I was a little shocked at how much I have done compared to him. I've struggled quite a bit this week and I can't help but feel like I am way behind.

  Next we talked a little more about the responsive CSS and introduced a little bit of the media query elements of CSS. I was relieved that this was simple and straight forward because I don't think I could handle another huge load of stuff to learn right now.

  After lunch we paired up to do the lab assignment, which was really fun in my opinion. It was MUCH better having goal to achieve using the CSS and having someone to work with just made it that much better. I like to consider myself a team oriented individual so in my opinion played well to my skillset.
