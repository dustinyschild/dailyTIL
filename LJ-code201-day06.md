<h1>Code 201, Day 6</h1>
  <p>
    Today we started talking about the Document Object Model, while seeing the tree as a
    visual representation made sense, I still have a hard time with how the javascript ties in.
    I think as with everything, it's just going to take some practice.

    I am still exhausted from the weekend so I am going
    to cut this a little short and get  some sleep
