<h1>Code 201, Day 3</h1>
  <p>
    Today we started by code reviewing my code. This was very helpful as Keith pointed out some things that I had not even thought about hen it came to troubleshooting my code.
    During code reviews I realized that I was writing code much differently than my peers. I seem to be one of the only ones using functions to structure my code.

  <h2>Learning CSS<h2>
  <p>
    I didn't give myself much time to play around with the different elements of CSS, seeing how the syntax is laid out helped with some of the confusion I had about how to use it effectively.

    Lab time today was difficult because we were essentially adding on to our existing game. This was very hard because of the way I had written my code the previous day.
