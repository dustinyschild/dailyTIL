<h1>Code 301, Day 10</h1>

<p>
  Today, was a hard day, we covered the topic of functional programming which, at face value, seems much easier than it is in practice. My partner and I had a difficult time getting through the assignment(we still haven't finished). Like I said, functional programming is not my forte, the assignment really challenged me to think differently than the way I have been programming thus far. That being said, as soon as I realized how I needed to shift my thinking, it started to become easier.
