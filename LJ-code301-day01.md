<h1>Code 301, Day 1</h1>

<p>
  Today was the first day back to class! We talked about several things, one of which was making our pages more responsive and easier to build using a few different techniques including SMACSS, as well as starting with moblile layout first.
  I enjoyed the paired programming exercise very much, I think it's a lot easier to work with existing code than trying to build from scratch.
