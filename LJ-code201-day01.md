<h1>Code 201, Day 1</h1>

<body>
  <p>
  Today we started off the class going over the book readings, from day 1 of class. I found this very helpful and gave me a more solid understanding of the concepts brought up through discussion. While discussion was going on I was playing around with the git command line, which I am feeling much more confident with.

  In the afternoon we started on our About Me pages, with which I had some issues. It took me quite a while to figure out what was wrong but the errors turned out to be minor. For example: I had declared a function and was passing in the wrong variable as parameter for that function, therefore that variable was technically undefined.

  Today was exhausting but all in all I think I am making good progress. I intend to keep working hard and consistently evaluate what my strengths and weaknesses are.
