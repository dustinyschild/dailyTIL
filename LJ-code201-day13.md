<h1>Code 201, Day 13</h1>

<p>
  Today we covered a new concept concerning storing data in the browser. I didn't get much time to actually get some practice in but it seems straight forward enough. The only thing I might have some difficulty with is retrieving the information since it is always stored as strings, but I think I just have to parse out each key: value pair.
