<h1>Code 301, Day 3</h1>

<p>
  Today I thought went a little easier than the way the rest of the week has been going. It has been a constant struggle trying to get enough sleep, but I finally was able to catch a bit of a break tonight with having less homework.

  I like the jQuery event handlers a lot! They make life so much simpler and DOM manipulation in jQuery in general is awesome, I still am getting the hang of which selectors I should use where, but other than that things are going well.
