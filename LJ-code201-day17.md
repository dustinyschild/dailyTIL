<h1>Code 201,Day 17</h1>

<p>
  Today was day 2 of project week and while I learned a lot today there were somsthings that became pretty apparent to me.
  One of those things being how much I need to learn how to break down problems. I think not having this skill has been a major stumbling block this whole class. I knew that it was an issue and it's something I'm trying to work on but I didn't realize how big of an impact it has made on being able to progress through building these projects. I am very happy that my teammates are such good resources and that I am in a place where I can learn from them.
