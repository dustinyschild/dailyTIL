<h1>Code 201, Day 5<h1>
 <p>
  Today marked the end of the first week of codeschool. So far I think everyone is making good progress, there are some minor adjustments that are planned to be implemented that will make certain areas of class more effective.

  For example, Jess and I talked about some ways to improve the teaching segment of class. We both agreed that making examples ahead of time would give a little more structure and guidance to the program. In my opinion this would help me start digging into some of the CSS side of things and give me a structure as to what I should be making with the styling. Right now it feels like trying to practice archery without having a target.

  All in all I would say this first week has been a success and I'm excited to keep on keeping on!
