<h1>Code 301, Day 8/9</h1>

<p>
  The last couple of days we have started talking about more of the back end of the development process. We learned how to set up a server to communicate with our machines with a javascript file. We also learned how to create and manipulate databases via a psql terminal as well as how to write javascript functions to take user input and add it to the database. We can also return data to the user though SQL queries. I have felt like banging my head on the wall with confusion but I think I have been getting it, slowly but surely.
