<h1>Code 201, Day 20</h1>

<p>
  Today was the last day of our Code 201 class and man does that feel good! we are a quarter of the way through the DeltaV program at this point and that is super exciting! It's been a tough week trying to plow our way through the final project but now that it's over I can catch up on the previous assignments and get more points, as well as get some much needed sleep. I think we all have learned a lot for this being the first ever run though of this class and I can't wait to see what Code 301 holds in store.
