<h1>Code 301, Day 11/12</h1>

<p>
  I am going to admit right now that I'm pretty lost. Things are not clicking well at all, I'm just constantly confused as to what we are doing, and why we would want to do what ever that is. I try to review what the in class code is doing to apply it to my portfolio project and end up confusing myself even more. Also, I tried adding my old branches with some working pieces I have and now I'm locked out of half my files. I need a lot of help at this point.
