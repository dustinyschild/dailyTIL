<h1>Code 301, Day 6</h1>

<p>
  Today, we talked about JSON and AJAX. Nate taught today which I thought he did a good job, I like the way he follow the slides exactly and any deviations were typically examples which were used to further elaborate on certain items.

  The AJAX stuff makes some sense to me but I am still trying to figure out how to implement it into my current project. I have one complaint about the in class assignments, I've been trying to model my portfolio assignment after them and the starter code changes form assignment.
