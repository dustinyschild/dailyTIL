<h1>Code 201, Day 16</h1>

<p>
  Today was the first day of Code 201 project week and so far I think we have a good start on our project. I think our group is working well together, everyone is agreeable and the work that we have specified for each person is coming along nicely. I think the biggest problem we faced today was keeping our minimum viable product in mind. Take keeping track of dates for example, while it would be great to have and may even seem completely necessary, it would have cost us a lot of time trying to add that feature, not to mention coding everything else around that parameter which realistically would not make it into the project by the end of the week.

    Now that we are coming down the home stretch of the 201 class, I am feeling a little low on energy, but I am trying my best to keep up. I should basically be done moving out of my old place and it feels good to be settled into my new home for the most part.
