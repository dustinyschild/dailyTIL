<h1>Code201, Day 18</h1>

<p>
  Today was the third day of project week and I think by the end of the day
  things were coming together nicely. We are very close to having a presentable
  mvp to present on Friday. I had a tough time getting thru the piece of the
  project I was given to do, but I knew that was going to be the case. I am just
  happy I got thru it and I'm realizing I just need to practice solving problems.
  Problem solving I think is an skill that I've lost a little bit since I was in
  school last.
