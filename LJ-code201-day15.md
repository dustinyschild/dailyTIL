<h1>Code 201, Day 15</h1>

<p>
  Today I was pretty excited that my project was picked for one of the project week projects. I feel like I have a strong team With Benjamin and Chuck both having strengths in their own areas, which really rounds out the group. I am excited to test my skills as a managerial type as well as learn from my teammates. Ben specifically I feel like I have a lot that I can learn from, especially in the ways of the javascript and the logic side in general. I do however have two major concerns for this group. The first being that I think that we could very easily get in the weeds with setting to high of expectations. I think we will have to be very explicit in what we want in our MVP in order to work effectively.
  My second worry is keeping Ben engaged with our project, I am fully aware that this is not the project he wanted to be assigned to, that being said I think he has worked long enough in a professional setting that this will not be an issue but it is something that I will be paying attention to. Thats all for now, I am excited to see what everyone will have come up with at the end of next week!
