<h1>Code201, Day 8</h1>
  <p>
    Today the topic was creating forms in html.
    these did not seem all that complicated to me so I decided to use most of my work time to tackle some of the things we had discussed in days prior.
    I had a very hard time learning how to set up the tables and using the DOM in general.
    I was starting to get pretty anxious about not figuring it out but I just had to take a step back and breakdown the problem and not overthink it.

      I know I am behind but getting this road block out of the way and with the weekend coming up, I know I can get this done!
